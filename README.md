# Traffic Analyzer

Climate change is a crucial problem in our generation and one factor that has a significant impact
on it is air pollution. Air pollution is caused by factories, automobiles and aerosols. To prevent further
damage due to air pollution, we must understand its causes, specifically, the effect of car emissions.
Hence, we will be looking at the relationship between the number of cars in a certain area within a specific
time frame.

For this project, we decided to use a microcontroller (in this case, a Raspberry Pi Zero W) to
detect and count the number of automobiles heading west on the Massachusetts turnpike at around 2pm
in a sunny afternoon. This can be done by using the camera capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W and
a video processing algorithm.
